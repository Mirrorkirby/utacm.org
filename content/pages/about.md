## What is ACM?

The Association for Computing Machinery is a student chapter of the national
[ACM][acm] at the University of Texas at Austin, and exists to create a
community among Computer Science students and anyone interested in technology.
The ACM holds events that serve its members or the community, events that
members are interested in attending, and is open to any new projects or ideas
proposed.

## What does the ACM do?

The ACM holds a wide range of social, professional, academic, and service events
each semester. Primary events of the ACM include our annual Big Event (a
barbecue and student/faculty mixer), faculty lectures, company nights, LAN
parties, programming contests, and the general meeting.  Smaller, more irregular
events include: movie nights, bowling nights, paintball, laser tag, tubing,
broomball, and camping.  There are also a few officer-only events.

## Who is the ACM?

The ACM consists of Senior Officers, Exective Officers (ex-senior officers who
give advice and assistance to the current Senior Officers), Officers, Junior
Officers (members trained to become officers), and members.
Contact information for Senior Officers is on the Contact page. You can also
view the full list of officers.
