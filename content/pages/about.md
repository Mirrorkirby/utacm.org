## Who We Are

We are The University of Texas at Austin's official student chapter of the
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). We exist to foster a tightly-knit
community, primarily amongst Computer Sciences students at the University, by
offering an assortment of social, academic, and corporate events.  We are an
extremely active organization--let the numbers speak for themselves.
