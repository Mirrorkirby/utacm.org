## What is ACM?

The Association for Computing Machinery is a student chapter of the national
[ACM][acm] at the University of Texas at Austin, and exists to create a
community among Computer Science students and anyone interested in technology.

We exist to foster a tightly-knit community, primarily amongst Computer Sciences
students at the University, by offering an assortment of social, academic, and
corporate events.

## What does the ACM do?

The ACM holds a wide range of social, professional, academic, and service events
each semester. Primary events of the ACM include our annual Big Event (a
barbecue and student/faculty mixer), faculty lectures, company nights, LAN
parties, programming contests, and the general meeting.  Smaller, more irregular
events include: movie nights, bowling nights, paintball, laser tag, tubing,
broomball, and camping.  There are also a few officer-only events.
