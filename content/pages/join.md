## How do I become a member?

The fastest way you can join ACM is to stop at our office ans speak to an
officer. Our office is in [GDC 3.304][gdc] near the third floor lab (the room
with the ACM logo on the window).

You can also attend our weekly meeting on Wednesdays, at 7:00 PM in [GDC
4.302][gdc].

Make sure to join our [Facebook group][fb] and announcements [mailing
list][ml] (~1 email per week).

## How much are the dues?

Dues are $20 a year, and can be paid by cash or check in the ACM office. You are
not an ACM member until your dues are paid. However, if you're a member of
national ACM, your dues are discounted to $5. Just come by the office and show
us your current ACM membership card, or give us your member number.

## How do I become an Officer?

Becoming an officer is easy! Just show up to the first general meeting each
semester and there will be an announcement for a second meeting reserved for
officer recruitment.
